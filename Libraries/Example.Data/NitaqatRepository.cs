This means that this repository method has been called outside of the scope of a DbContextScope. A repository must only be accessed within the scope of a DbContextScope, which takes care of creating the DbContext instances that the repositories need and making them available as ambient contexts. This is what ensures that, for any given DbContext-derived type, the same instance is used throughout the duration of a business transaction. To fix this issue, use IDbContextScopeFactory in your top-level business logic service method to create a DbContextScope that wraps the entire business transaction that your service method implements. Then access this repository within that scope. Refer to the comments in the IDbContextScope.cs file for more details.");
